## GSM Arena API

This is unofficial API and just for code learning. That is using [Google Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/) to serve API. And then use [cheerio for Google Apps Script](https://github.com/tani/cheeriogs) to web data crwal in Google Script

If you want to run this code in your Google Script project. You can upload all of the code files. But you need to add Cheerio lib in your project. [How to add external lib in Google Script?](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/libraries)
